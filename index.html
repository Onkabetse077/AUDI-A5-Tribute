            If the car is between 100,000 and 200,000 kilometres (62,000 and 124,000 mi) and below five years, Audi fully pays the hardware but only half of the work.

            Audi is replacing the A4/S4 sedan with the A5/S5 fastback as part of Audi's new strategy of allocating even numbers to electric vehicles and odd numbers to combustion cars.
